# Course readings
This repository was created so that students at Bob Jones University don't have to pay $30 for a textbook that is exclusively articles that other people wrote. The articles listed here are all from the January 2021 edition of the book. 
## Contributions
If the book is updated, feel free to fork this repository and send me a PR.
